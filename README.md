It is my own game engine project.  
The project started on October 21, 2019.  
This project uses external libraries Eigen3, SDL2.  

The project has been suspended for a short time since January 15, 2020.  
Because learning is not enough, I will study more and challenge again.  
But it was never completely stopped.  
I am currently working on a sub-project ArenaBoss.  
I will complete ArenaBoss, grow and come back.  
I am sorry to those who came in anticipation of my engine project.  
Stay tuned to ArenaBoss for now. Thanks.
